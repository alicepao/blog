<p>This project is designed to show students’ praxis performance for those majoring in teacher’s education department. This is only a part of the project. The end goal is to evalutate if a student’s praxis score can predict wheather he or she becomes a successful teacher.</p>
<section id="data-source" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-source">Data Source</h2>
<p>The data was collected from a higher-education instition in Idaho. Subjects are students from the institute’s teacher education department. All students’ identities are shielded.</p>
</section>
<section id="data-definition" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="data-definition">Data Definition</h2>
<ul>
<li><p><code>student_id</code>: a unique identifier for students majoring in education department.</p></li>
<li><p><code>test_name</code>: different praxis tests</p></li>
<li><p><code>test_code</code>: a unique identifier for praxis tests</p></li>
<li><p><code>first_score</code>: the score a student got when he or she first took the praxis test. If a student takes multiple praxis tests (different test codes), then he or she will have multiple first scores.</p></li>
<li><p><code>last_score</code>: the score a student got for his or her last praxis test. Again, if a student takes multiple praxis tests (different test codes), there will be multiple last scores.</p></li>
<li><p><code>n_attempt</code>: indicates the total attempts a student has for each praxis test he or she takes. For example, if a student took Middle School English Language Arts test 17 times, his n_attempt will be 17.</p></li>
<li><p><code>n_attempt_pass</code>: indicates the number of tests a student passed for a specific praxis test. For example, if a student took Middle School English Language Arts test 17 times and didn’t pass any of it, then his n_attempt_pass will be 0.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ever_pass</code>: indicates if a student eventually passed the test or not.</p></li>
<li><p><code>state_passing_score</code>: indicates the minimum score a student is required to pass a certain praxis test. This threshold is determined by Idaho’s education department.</p></li>
<li><p><code>first_test_date</code>: the first test date a student took his or her very first test.</p></li>
<li><p><code>last_test_date</code>: the last test data a student took his or her very last test.</p></li>
<li><p><code>total_tests</code>: the total number count for each test.</p></li>
<li><p><code>average_first_score</code>: the average test score for all students first attempt.</p></li>
<li><p><code>first_standard_deviation</code>: the standard deviation for all students’ first attempt.</p></li>
<li><p><code>first_z_score</code>: the z score for all students’ first attempt.</p></li>
<li><p><code>average_last_score</code>: the average test score for all students’ last attempt.</p></li>
<li><p><code>last_standard_deviation</code>: the standard deviation for all students’ last attempt.</p></li>
<li><p><code>last_z_score</code>: the z score for all students’ z score.</p></li>
<li><p><code>first_score_cutoff</code>: points away from the state’s passing standard for a student’s first attempt</p></li>
<li><p><code>last_score_cutoff</code>: points away from the state’s passing standard for a student’s last attempt</p></li>
<li><p><code>average_z_score</code>: the average z score taken from the first and last attempt z score</p></li>

<p>When I first got my hands on this data set, each row represents all tests taken from all students. Since each student can take multiple praxis test, there are a lot of data. However, as a team, we decided to only narrow down to the first and last test score per student per test.</p>
<p>There are 4 main parts of data transformation:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Only remain the first and last test per student per test</li>
<li>Calculate the # of attempts, # of passed attempts, if a student ever passed</li>
<li>Grab the date for first and last test</li>
<li>Join all data frames together</li>
</ol>
<p>The following are my code for data wrangling:</p>
